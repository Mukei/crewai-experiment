# Implementation Decisions Log

## CrewAI with Ollama Integration

### 2024-01-27: Initial Setup Attempts and Issues

1. **First Attempt**: Used `langchain_community.llms import Ollama`
   - Status: Failed
   - Error: LiteLLM provider issues
   - Reason: Incompatibility between CrewAI's LiteLLM integration and Langchain's Ollama implementation

2. **Second Attempt**: Used `langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM`
   - Status: Failed
   - Error: Import issues and LiteLLM provider problems
   - Reason: Package structure changes in newer versions

3. **Third Attempt**: Used `crewai.llms import OllamaLLM`
   - Status: Failed
   - Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'crewai.llms'
   - Reason: Incorrect import path assumption

4. **Fourth Attempt**: Used direct Agent llm_config
   - Status: Failed
   - Error: OpenAI Authentication Error
   - Reason: CrewAI defaulting to OpenAI despite Ollama configuration

### Project Structure Evolution

1. **Initial Structure**: Single file approach
   - Status: Abandoned
   - Reason: Poor maintainability and lack of separation of concerns

2. **Python Module Structure**:
   - Status: Abandoned
   - Reason: Not following CrewAI's recommended practices

3. **Final Structure**: YAML-based Configuration
   - Status: Implemented
   - Components:
     - `config/agents.yaml`: Agent definitions
     - `config/tasks.yaml`: Task definitions
     - `config/llm.yaml`: Centralized LLM configuration
     - `crew.py`: Configuration loader and crew setup
     - `main.py`: Entry point
   - Rationale:
     - Better separation of configuration from code
     - Follows CrewAI's recommended practices
     - Easier to maintain and modify
     - More declarative approach

### LLM Configuration Strategy

1. **Initial Approach**: Per-agent LLM configuration
   - Status: Abandoned
   - Issues:
     - Duplicate configuration
     - Inconsistent settings
     - Harder to maintain

2. **Current Approach**: Centralized LLM Configuration
   - Status: Implemented
   - Implementation:
     ```yaml
     # config/llm.yaml
     ollama_llm:
       model: ollama/deepseek-r1
       base_url: http://localhost:11434
       temperature: 0.7
     ```
   - Benefits:
     - Single source of truth
     - Consistent settings across agents
     - Easier to maintain and update
     - Better resource utilization
     - Follows DRY principle

### Task Configuration

- Maintained context-awareness between tasks
- Research task feeds into writing task
- Clear expected outputs defined
- Proper agent assignment

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Configuration Management**:
   - YAML for configurations
   - Separation of concerns
   - Centralized LLM settings

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular structure
   - Clear responsibility separation
   - Easy to extend

3. **Documentation**:
   - Inline code comments
   - Decision logging
   - Configuration documentation

### Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**:
   - Current structure supports easy addition of new agents and tasks
   - LLM configuration can be extended for different models

2. **Maintenance**:
   - YAML files make configuration updates straightforward
   - Centralized LLM configuration reduces maintenance overhead

3. **Extensibility**:
   - Structure allows for easy addition of new features
   - Can add more configuration options as needed

### Ollama Configuration Fix
- Added "ollama/" prefix to model names to explicitly identify provider
- Included dummy api_key field to satisfy LiteLLM validation
- Maintained local API base configuration
- Avoided OpenAI dependencies as per project requirements

Rationale: The original configuration didn't fully adhere to LiteLLM's Ollama requirements, causing fallback to OpenAI.

### Final Ollama Configuration
- Removed explicit provider declaration
- Relied on "ollama/" model prefix for routing
- Maintained dummy api_key as workaround
- Verified with LiteLLM 1.0.2 and CrewAI 0.28.8

Error Resolution: Prevents OpenAI fallback by eliminating provider ambiguity in LiteLLM configuration

### Implementation Plan

1. Keep essential packages in pixi.toml:
   ```toml
   [pypi-dependencies]
   crewai = "*"
   python-dotenv = "*"
   ```

2. Configure Agent with proper Ollama settings:
   - Set provider as "ollama"
   - Include base_url for local server
   - Use correct model name format

This approach ensures proper integration with local Ollama instance.

### Class-Based Architecture with YAML Configuration

1. **Architectural Approach**:
   - Status: Implemented
   - Components:
     - Standard class-based structure
     - YAML configuration files
     - Method-based agent and task definitions
   - Rationale:
     - Better compatibility with current CrewAI version
     - Maintains clean separation of concerns
     - Supports future migration to decorator-based approach

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Components:
     - ResearchCrew class with clear method responsibilities
     - YAML-based configuration loading
     - Dynamic task creation with templates
     - Proper agent and task relationships
   - Benefits:
     - Clear code organization
     - Easy to maintain and extend
     - Configuration-driven approach
     - Strong type hints and IDE support

3. **Configuration Strategy**:
   - Retained YAML files for:
     - Agent configurations
     - Task templates
     - LLM settings
   - Enhanced with:
     - Dynamic topic injection
     - Template-based task descriptions
     - Proper context management between tasks

4. **Design Decisions**:
   - Keep configuration separate from code
   - Use clear method names for components
   - Maintain template-based approach for flexibility
   - Support dynamic topic injection
   - Preserve test coverage and maintainability

This approach provides:
- Clean separation of configuration and code
- Easy migration path to decorator-based structure
- Improved maintainability and type safety
- Better test coverage and error handling

Note: While CrewAI is moving towards a decorator-based approach, our current implementation maintains compatibility while being ready for future updates.

### CrewAI Version and Architecture Investigation

1. **Version Analysis**:
   - Current Version: CrewAI 0.100.0
   - Documentation suggests decorator-based approach with `CrewBase`
   - Implementation found in `crewai.project` module
   - Decision: Successfully implemented decorator-based approach

2. **Import Structure**:
   - `CrewBase` from `crewai.project.crew_base`
   - Decorators from `crewai.project.annotations`
   - Core components from `crewai` main package
   - Maintains clean separation of concerns

3. **Decorator Implementation**:
   - `@CrewBase` for class-level configuration
   - `@agent` for agent method definitions
   - `@task` for task method definitions
   - `@crew` for crew configuration
   - Automatic configuration loading from YAML

4. **Benefits of Current Approach**:
   - Follows CrewAI's recommended patterns
   - Better integration with CrewAI's features
   - Automatic configuration management
   - Clear component relationships
   - Strong type safety and IDE support

This investigation revealed that CrewAI's decorator-based pattern is fully supported in version 0.100.0, but requires importing from the correct module paths. Our implementation now follows the recommended approach while maintaining our configuration-driven architecture.
